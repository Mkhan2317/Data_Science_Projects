## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- 🧠 **Advanced Pandas Workflows**  
  Go beyond standard tutorials — tackle messy, unstructured, and high-volume datasets.

- 🔗 **Pandas + SQL Integration**  
  Seamlessly combine Pandas with SQL for efficient querying, joins, and data extraction.

- 🌐 **APIs & JSON Handling**  
  Use REST APIs to pull real-time data from the web; parse and normalize nested JSON objects into clean DataFrames.

- 📈 **Finance Applications**  
  - Backtest and forward test momentum/trend-based investment strategies  
  - Track custom indexes and benchmark portfolios  
  - Handle financial time series and multi-asset data

- 🏠 **Machine Learning: Predict Real Estate Prices**  
  Full pipeline: feature engineering → model training → evaluation using Pandas + Scikit-Learn.

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
  Work with completely unclean, stringified, or nested data  
  Automate standardization, encoding, sampling, and transformation

- 📊 **Large Datasets**  
  Apply chunking, memory optimization, and performance tricks to handle millions of rows efficiently.
